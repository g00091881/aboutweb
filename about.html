        <h1>About AUS Campus Connect</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>AUS Campus Connect</strong> is a simple website designed for the American University of Sharjah community.
            The website helps students and staff stay updated on campus events and activities. It has two main pages:
        </p>

        <h2>1. Homepage</h2>
        <p>
            The homepage welcomes users with a navigation bar, the AUS logo, and a title. It features:
            <ul>
                <li>A button that links to the Event Submission Page.</li>
                <li>A carousel that shows images of the AUS campus, including a bird's-eye view, night view, and graduation photos.</li>
                <li>Static cards displaying sample events, such as National Day and Global Day, with images and brief descriptions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Event Submission Page</h2>
        <p>
            This page has a form where users can submit their own events by entering:
            <ul>
                <li>Event Name</li>
                <li>Date and Time</li>
                <li>Location</li>
                <li>Brief Description</li>
                <li>Organizer's Contact Information</li>
            </ul>
            When users submit the form, their event details are saved in the browser using <strong>localStorage</strong> and an alert confirms submission.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goal of the website is to create a simple and user-friendly platform for sharing and discovering events within the AUS campus community.
        </p>
